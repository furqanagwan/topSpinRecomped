# Contributing

Thanks for helping. Setup, building, adding a game, the codegen workflow and
code style are shared by every repository that uses the framework, so they live
in [recomp-framework's CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/furqanagwan/recomp-framework/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
Read that first; this file only covers what is specific to this repository.

## Where changes go

| Change | Repository |
| --- | --- |
| A Top Spin game: codegen config, seeds, game-only kernel stubs, settings, README, research notes | This repository, in the game's folder |
| Installer, menus, input, settings UI, packaging or analysis scripts | [recomp-framework](https://github.com/furqanagwan/recomp-framework), then update the `framework` submodule here |
| Recompiler, kernel, graphics, audio, file system | [furqanagwan/rexglue-sdk](https://github.com/furqanagwan/rexglue-sdk) |

## Testing a change

Say in your pull request which games and disc regions you tested, and for how
long (boot to menus, an exhibition match, career mode...). Record anything new you
learn about a game in its `docs/NOTES.md`, and keep the status tables in the
game's README honest.

Updating the framework submodule:

```
git -C framework pull origin main
git add framework
```

## Making a release

Releases can only be built by someone who owns the game, because codegen needs
`default.xex`. For each game:

1. Update `framework` to the commit you want and make sure the working tree is
   clean.
2. Install the SDK from `framework/thirdparty/rexglue-sdk` (see the framework
   guide) so the build uses the pinned SDK.
3. Build a release: `.\framework\scripts\build.ps1 -Game <GAME>`.
4. Play-test it from a fresh folder: extract the zip produced in the next step
   somewhere new, run it, install from the ISO and play.
5. Package and publish:
   ```
   .\framework\scripts\package_release.ps1 -Game <GAME> -Version <x.y.z>
   .\framework\scripts\package_release.ps1 -Game <GAME> -Version <x.y.z> -Publish
   ```
   This creates the tag `<GAME>-v<x.y.z>` (for example `topspin3-v0.1.0`) and
   a GitHub release with the zip, system requirements from `<GAME>/release.json`
   and the SHA-256. Add `-Draft` to review it before it goes public; a version
   with a suffix such as `0.1.0-beta.1` is marked as a pre-release.
6. Update the game README's status table if anything changed.

Each game is released separately, so a Top Spin 3 fix doesn't need a new
Top Spin 4 release.
