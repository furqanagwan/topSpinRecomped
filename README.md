# topSpinRecomped

Unofficial native PC versions of 2K Sports' Top Spin tennis games for Xbox 360, made by
statically recompiling the original game code with
[ReXGlue](https://github.com/rexglue/rexglue-sdk). Download the game's
executable, point it at your own Xbox 360 disc image, and play.

This repository and its releases contain no game data: no disc images, game
files or extracted assets. You must own the game.

| Game | Supported disc | Status | Download |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Top Spin 3](topspin3/README.md) | 🇺🇸 🇪🇺 USA, Europe (`545407FF`) | Boots to the front end | [Releases](https://github.com/furqanagwan/topSpinRecomped/releases?q=topspin3) |
| [Top Spin 4](topspin4/README.md) | 🇺🇸 🇪🇺 USA, Europe (`54540859`) | Plays the intro video, crashes before the front end | |

## Playing

1. Check the [system requirements](#system-requirements) and install the
   [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (x64)](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).
2. Download the game's zip from [Releases](https://github.com/furqanagwan/topSpinRecomped/releases)
   and extract it to a folder you can write to (not Program Files).
3. Run the game's `.exe` and choose your Xbox 360 ISO when asked. The files are
   copied next to the executable once; the ISO isn't needed after that.

Check your disc against the game's supported regions first (see its README):
each release is recompiled from one regional executable.

### Controls

- Xbox, PlayStation, Switch and Steam Deck controllers work out of the box; all
  controllers drive player 1 unless *All controllers control player 1* is turned
  off in Settings.
- System menu (Resume, Settings, Exit Game): press **View + Menu** together, or
  **Esc**. The Guide button is left to Windows Game Bar and Steam unless
  `guide_button = true`.

### DLC

Put downloadable content packages (the `CON`, `LIVE` or `PIRS` files from an
Xbox 360 `Content\0000000000000000\<TitleID>\00000002` folder) in the `dlc`
folder next to the executable. Each package is checked against the game's title
ID and installed on the next start. Title updates are skipped: they replace game
code, so they need a new recompilation.

### Saves and settings

Saves, settings and logs go to your user folder; Settings > Game files shows
where. An empty `portable.txt` next to the executable keeps them beside it.

## System requirements

| | Required |
| --- | --- |
| OS | Windows 10 version 2004 (build 19041) or Windows 11, 64-bit |
| Processor | 64-bit x86 CPU with SSE4.1 |
| Graphics | DirectX 12 GPU (feature level 11_0) |
| Memory | 8 GB RAM recommended |
| Storage | Top Spin 3: 4.5 GB, Top Spin 4: 6 GB, plus room for the ISO while it is copied |
| Software | [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2015-2022 (x64)](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) |
| Game | Your own Xbox 360 disc image of a supported region |

Tested on an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 Laptop GPU and
32 GB RAM running Windows 11. Lower-end hardware hasn't been tested yet; reports
are welcome. Linux, macOS and Steam Deck builds compile but have no releases and
haven't been play-tested.

## Developing

The shared app framework (installer, menus, input, packaging scripts) lives in
[recomp-framework](https://github.com/furqanagwan/recomp-framework), included here
as the `framework` submodule together with the ReXGlue fork.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/furqanagwan/topSpinRecomped.git
cd topSpinRecomped
rexglue extract "<your disc>.iso" topspin3\assets
.\framework\scripts\build.ps1 -Game topspin3
```

```
framework/                  recomp-framework submodule (with thirdparty/rexglue-sdk)
topspin3/                   Top Spin 3: descriptor, codegen config, settings, GDK/UWP metadata
topspin4/                   Top Spin 4: the same, plus per-module configs for its two DLLs
